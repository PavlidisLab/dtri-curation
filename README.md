## Experiment level curation identifies high confidence transcriptional regulatory interactions in neurodevelopment

The capacity to computationally reconstruct gene regulatory networks using large-scale biological data is currently limited by the absence of a high confidence set of one-to-one regulatory interactions. Given the lengthy history of using small scale experimental assays to investigate individual interactions, we hypothesize that a reliable collection of gene regulatory interactions could be compiled by systematically inspecting the published literature. To this end, we developed a curation protocol to examine and record evidence of regulatory interactions at the individual experiment level. Focusing on the area of brain development, we applied our pipeline to 1,310 publications. We identified 3,601 individual experiments, providing detailed information about 1,499 regulatory interactions. Many of these interactions have verified activity specifically in the embryonic brain. By capturing reports of regulatory interactions at this level of granularity, we present a resource that is more interpretable than other similar resources.
